Here is an example for later review:
Open a new or existing file with vim filename .
Type i to switch into insert mode so that you can start editing the file.
Enter or modify the text with your file.
Once you're done, press the escape key Esc to get out of insert mode and back to command mode.
Type :wq to save and exit your file.
